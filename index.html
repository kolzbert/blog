          <h1>Construction Waste Disposal Status And Construction Waste Disposal Crusher</h1>

<p>Over time, China's construction waste cycle reuse career is gradually on the right track, local governments have introduced policies to support the steady development of the industry. However, due to a late start, China's construction waste disposal there are still problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>1, construction waste is treated, but consumptive venues still insufficient</li>
</ul><p>One hand, everyday needs to deal with at least thousands of tons, but only very difficult to consume such a large amount of material for making bricks or plate; On the other hand, even if does not affect the deep processing of construction waste, conservation of finished goods pile up need a lot of venues to match likely to cause the product backlog, or even result in the discontinuation of the treatment plant's ability to "digest" severely disrupted.</p>

<ul>
<li>2, outdated facilities, can not be classified processing</li>
</ul><p>Construction waste brick-making factory, for example, the use of fixed-crushing equipment, and therefore can not do the construction waste classification, the different quality of raw materials produced brick products, light in weight, weight range strength soft, hard mixed, the product quality is very unstable.
Environmental projects cause secondary pollution.</p>

<p>Construction waste recycling This in itself is a green field project, therefore, should be avoided in terms of noise, dust, soot and other secondary pollution.</p>

<ul>
<li>3, fixed broken equipment, the high cost of venue garbage transfer</li>
</ul><p>It is understood that the construction waste, building waste treatment plants in stacking area occupied about half of the area of plant, fixed crusher daily operations have to spend a lot of manpower, material concentration of construction waste to broken mouth processing. Over time, the large number of of this venue transit costs is quite amazing.</p>

<p>For the above reasons, construction of waste treatment plants have turned to the exploration of the new model, which mainly environmentally advanced mobile crushing equipment. The device can effectively solve the above problems, also will increase its production and processing of aggregate range of applications, mainly used for municipal, highway construction industry, a small part of the supply system the brickyard or other industry use.</p>

<p>Most construction waste treatment plants are the existence of a "material supply base" model. The first construction waste classification, and then used for municipal road and highway construction. Such as: cement stabilized layer processing grassroots sidewalks, construction of access roads construction, pipe pit backfilling, soft ground treatment. Run the validation of this processing mode through the past few years, not only for companies to create considerable economic benefits, it also brings excellent social effects.</p>

<p>At present, China's construction waste recycling projects are generally concentrated in the large and medium-sized cities, and city in the land is relatively tight, material supply base building waste treatment plants built model of its obvious advantages: 1, relatively small investment, easy management; factories less land, materials fast turnover; 3, advanced mobile crushing equipment operation, environmental protection and good is not easy to cause secondary pollution, but also when dealing with a large amount when crushing task to the completion of the construction site, and save on shipping to reduce The traffic pressure; 4, lower floor construction waste transit costs, low operating costs.
Of course, this processing mode requires government departments to formulate relevant supporting policies, such as the development of building waste treatment plants and environmental protection standards, construction waste to produce aggregate materials standards, construction units, brick, concrete batching plant and other enterprises preferred construction garbage aggregate of preferential policies.</p>
